5,"Totally in love with the Auro of the place, really beautiful and quite fancy at the same time. The ambience is very pure and gives a sense of positivity throughout. Outdoor and indoor interior are quite quaint and cute. Love the open kitchen idea and there whole marketplace ideology. Due to coronovirus they specifically use disposable cutlery to keep the pandemic in mind taking all the precautionary measures from the beginning of the place with the mask on their staff and using good sanitisation. The food is really amazing specially the pizza straight from the oven and the hummus and pita bread are quite delicious too. If you're looking for a classy yet soothing Italian place in Delhi,Fatjar is a go to for you!"

5,We were few friends and was a birthday celebration. The food was so good in taste and it was really fresh. We all loved it and highly recomment.
5,Fatjar Cafe and Market is the perfect place for a casual lunch with your loved ones. The Ambience is delightful and the food is totally the best thing about the place! YOu can purchase your choosing of Olives and a lot more directly from the place. They are taking all the prevention measures for the spread of COVID-19 and I can say this without hesitation that it is by far the most safest place felt after looking at their actions ?
5,"Hey Guys, if you are craving for pizza and searching for it then you should visit this cafe. Yes, I highly recommend you to visit this FatJar Cafe because the cafe offers scrumptious pizza. I have ordered Veggie Pizza which was really awesome. Apart from that, I have also ordered Cappuccino and one soft drink. If I talk about the ambiance then no doubt, because it is absolutely pretty. From my side I'll give 5/5 for this cafe. It is completely amazing. I had a great experience with this cafe. Here are some pictures have a look "
5,"We were looking for a special meal and we found it at the FatJar . Well presented and tasty food , whilst it is more expensive than we usually pay , it was well worth the experience. I had Chicken with roast vegetables, the chicken was tender and tasty and the vegetables tasted like vegetables, my husband ate a pasta dish , which by Indian standards was very good.  If you are looking for a holiday from Indian food and don¡¯t mind the small extra expense then treat yourselves to this restaurant. They also have a Range of wine and beer."
5,"Kailash colony is brimming with small cafes now. I happened to visit this beauty for lunch and was amazed with the 1st impression it made.  We started with Falafel & Pita and Margherita Pizza. Safe to say, Margherita pizza was the best choice of the day. Its made freshly in front of you in the Wood Fired oven. The taste was exquisite and I would recommend this to anybody who plans to visit this outlet. I could come here just to have that Pizza. Hummus, Pita and Falafel were a good side dish while we ordered the next couple of dishes. We moved on to order Fussili Alfredo. This white sauce fussili pasta was good but could not be compared to the pizza we had earlier.  In the end, we went for Frozen Yoghurt with Honey. It is recommended to have it with honey, which will do wonders to the frozen yoghurt!  This place turned out to be quite peaceful and the plants enhanced its beauty."
5,"If you are looking for a varied selection of delicious, high quality dishes, this is your place. We spent three weeks traveling around India, and our best meals of the trip were unquestionably found here. Great place if you are tiring of the typical Indian dishes and are lusting for some ethnic variety. Oh, and do yourself a favor: You MUST get the Sticky Date Pudding with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. It may be the best dessert we have ever had."
